Task 3A
Simply created two variables Y and Z, and gave them values 300 and 30 repectively. Then assigned variable X to Y * Z

Task 3B
The OZ programming language is a multiparadigm programming language. Some of the most important paradigms the languege inherit is Lazy evaluation and concurrent programming. 
Since the concurrency is declarative, when a program encounters a unbound variable, it waits for its value. in our case
the thread will wait until both X and Y are bound before showing the value of Y.
